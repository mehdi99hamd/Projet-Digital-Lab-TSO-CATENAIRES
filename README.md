# Projet-Digital-Lab-TSO-CATENAIRES

In this project, a point cloud cutting tool was created to :

- Automatic identification of catenary poles.
- Creation of cuts through the poles that are perpendicular to the rails of the the track.
- Automatic naming of the cuts with coordinates.
- Export of the point cloud cuts in DXF or DWG format.



### Model Used : VGG-19

We have chosen the VGG-19 as the basis of our model. The VGG is the abbreviation of "Visual Geometry Group Net". It has been used in several classification problems. It has about 143 million parameters, which were trained using ImageNet, a database with 1.2 million images that contains thousands of classes. It has a very robust architecture used for comparative analysis. The VGG-19 neural network is composed of The neural network VGG-19 is composed of 19 layers of neural networks forming 5 blocks. We used the first four by adding three dense layers.
